# BDSD_Minor_Project
An emotion estimation project, worked on as part of the master engineering systems program

## Introduction
Emotion estimation from human faces expressions is common in the sociaty, since it help in improving communication and understanding among the different sides, so as part of building a social robot that could help the humans in their daily tasks it is helpful to integrate an emotion estimation algorithm to the camera that will be part of the robot and get feedback from the camera.

The model is built by training an LSTM network on the Blendshapes of the images in the dataset fer2013.
there was a long process of training optimization and evaluation until the model reached an accuracy of 72% which is the dataset benchmark with convolutional networks, so it was reasonable to start looking for a new dataset at that point given the error generated from MediaPipe, the deep learning model and and other parts of the process.

futher details can be found in the Docs directory

have not got another dataset or sponsorship to further improve and reached the time cap for the master's degree program to the project finished at this point.
